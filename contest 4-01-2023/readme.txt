1.sum_it
it was nothing but just adding 2 integers and checking if it is equal to the 3rd one 

2.Apple and oranges
it was just that you need to find hcf of two given numbers

3.Indivisible
it was to find an integer which does not divide any of the three integers

4.N_triplets
in this you needed to find 3 different integers which  when multiplied gives multiple of n and when any 2 multiplied is a divisor of n.
logic here is that you just need to take 1 as 1st one and then run a loop from 1 to sqrt (n) and see if there is a factor which when divided by n is not equal to the factor itself
the thing also is that these three numbers must have their product equal to need

5.NO_sequecnce
it was a tough one 
in this the logic simply was that you take the sequence backward and then subtract i=0 th term and check that if it is possible to divide it by multiplier.
this will give you the value of 1st term and then repeat it by also changing the sum.
